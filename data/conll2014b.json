                "explanation": "I partially agree with this correction because \"of\" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as \"the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced.\" First, this construction does not use \"of.\" Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, \"time spent on social media\" should come first and \"writing skills will be reduced\" should come second. \nThis suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say \"time used on social media sites.\" Instead, it is common to say \"time spent on social media sites\" or \"time spent using social media sites.\" Second, the phrase \"the more of the writing skills\" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase \"writing skills\" refers, so it should be changed to \"the more a person's writing skills.\" This makes the meaning clear."
